# Garden Project :seedling:

A garden web app allows gardeners to log their garden spending, planting, and harvesting data.
The data collected by the web app is used to predict crop productivity. Although there will likely be some
missing, inaccurate, or outlier data logged by the gardener, the analytical findings derived from
the data can give the user more confidence in estimating crop productivity.

## Part 1: Exploratory Data Analysis
Perform basic exploratory data analysis of garden datasets.
Create report with visuals outlining findings.

## Part 2: Dashboard for Reporting
Create a Tableau dashboard summarizing important findings and information.

## Part 3: Forecasting and Machine Learning
Create forecasting and machine learning models to predict
future harvests and determine which plants will be the most
profitable.

## Part 4: Connect to Database Using SQLAlchemy
Take Kaggle garden dataset and join with succession dataset in database
to make app that calculates succession planting dates.

## Part 5: Django web app
Create Django web app putting everything together.
