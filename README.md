# Garden Project :seedling:

A garden app allows gardeners to log their garden spending, planting, and harvesting data.
The data collected by the app is used to predict crop productivity. Although there will likely be some
missing, inaccurate, or outlier data logged by the gardener, the analytical findings derived from
the data can give the user more confidence in estimating crop productivity.

## Part 1: Exploring the data
Perform basic exploratory data analysis of garden datasets.
Create report with visuals outlining findings.

## Part 2: Forecasting and machine learning
Create forecasting and machine learning models to predict
future harvests and determine which plants will be the most
profitable.

## Part 3: Using SQLalchemy to work with database
Take Kaggle garden dataset and join with succession dataset in database
to make app that calculates succession planting dates.

## Part 4: Django web app
Create Django web app putting everything together.
