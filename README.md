# Garden Project :seedling:

## Introduction

Suppose there is a garden web app that allows gardeners to log their garden harvest data.
The data collected by the web app can help evaluate spending and crop productivity. Although there will likely be some
missing, inaccurate, or outlier data logged by the gardener, the analytical findings derived from
the data can give the user more confidence in garden spending and crop productivity.

### Part 1: Exploratory Data Analysis
Perform basic exploratory data analysis of garden harvest dataset.

### Part 2: Dashboard for Reporting
Create a Tableau dashboard summarizing important findings and information.
