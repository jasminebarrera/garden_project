# Garden Project Part 1: Exploratory Data Analysis

---

## Introduction

The goal of this part of the project is to demonstrate the basics of exploratory data analysis (EDA).
Through this routine but essential process, the analyst can become familiar with new data
and prepare it for further use in answering business questions. Analysts generally follow
the same EDA process, however, the steps involved may vary depending on the data and business goals.
